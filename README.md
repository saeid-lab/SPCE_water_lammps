**SPC/E water model**

A model for SPC/E water is created by moltemplate and some measurements are done by lammps package.

Main Repo:

 1. `Build_input` -> Design the Box and equilibration
 2. `Viscosity` -> Measuring the viscosity using Green-Kubo (GK) formula.
 3. `diffusion_coefficient_MSD` -> Measuring diffusion coefficient D based on MSD method.
 4. `VACF` -> Calculating VASF....
